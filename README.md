# BeeHave 3D Sample Project
 
### Tutorial and Demo

In this video, I go over the contents of the repository as well as an overview of both behavior trees in general and specifically how BeeHave works.

### Description

BeeHave is a great asset for behavior trees in Godot, but I found it difficult to learn.
Whenever I want to learn a new asset, I like to just tear apart some example projects. If that's you, this repository is for you! 
This is the implimentation of BeeHave in my current in-progress project: Ruins of Calica, ripped straight out of that game and put into this repository.

### Contents:

- A working project with a simple character controller and a slime enemy that wanders around when idle and chases and attacks the player when in range.
- Behavior trees for all the other enemies in my game. The actual enemies couldn't be included because I cannot distribute the models.
- Some custom decorator nodes I found helpful, for instance: UntilSucced (the opposite of UntilFailure)
